# Sketchbot

Sketchbot is a prototype for programming on tablets using a combination of sketching, handwriting, and chatbot assistance.  
It allows users to interact with code through gestures, handwriting input, and an integrated AI assistant (Gemini / GPT).

## Key Features

- Write code using handwriting recognition
- Use gesture-based commands (e.g. circle to select, X to delete, R to rename, ? to explain)
- Integrated AI chatbot for contextual help and code suggestions
- Work with multiple files via a built-in file drawer
- View and accept/reject AI-suggested code edits (diff view)
- Auto-format code using a gesture

## Getting Started

1. Insert your API keys:
   - In `lib/gemini.dart`: add your Google Gemini API key
   - In `lib/gpt.dart`: add your OpenAI GPT API key

2. Run the prototype
